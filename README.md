#"Thing" from the show Wednesday (or the Addams Family)

For this assignment, I evolved a hand that could walk. This was inspired by "Thing" from the Netflix show _Wednesday_. The fitness function was a measurement of how far the hand moved in the -x direction. Hands which moved further in the -x direction had higher fitnesses. A video of a hand with a randomly generated brain vs. an eveolved brain can be seen [here](https://youtu.be/WgInskeBIAA).

To run the program, simply type the following into the terminal window:

```bash
$ python3 search.py
```
